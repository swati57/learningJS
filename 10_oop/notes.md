## prototype

Prototype : Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.

Everything in Javascript is an object whether it be string , array, int

Even function is an object. And you can assign members to it.
